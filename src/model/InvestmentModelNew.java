/**
 * This class also represents a new model which extends the old model and implements new operations
 * that follows solid principles.
 * <p>In its simplest form, a stock of a company is simply a part of ownership in that company.
 * Ownership is divided into shares, where a share represents a fraction of the total ownership. For
 * example, Apple has about 5.2B shares. So if you own 100 shares, you own about 1.9X10 minus 6 of
 * the company and it would be worth about dollar20800 today. As a shareholder, you are an investor
 * in the company. An investor sends money to the company to buy some of its stock, and gets part
 * ownership in return. The total money invested in the stock money spent buying it is called the
 * cost basis of the purchase. The value of the stock on a particular day is the money the investor
 * would receive if he/she sold the stock on that day.</p>
 * <p>
 * Each publicly traded companys stock is given a unique ticker symbol which is used to trade it for
 * example, Apple Inc. is AAPL, Microsoft is MSFT The price of stock keeps changing all day
 * depending on how many people want to own that stock versus how many people want to sell their
 * shares. The behavior of a US stock during a day can be understood by its opening price at 8am EST
 * when the New York Stock Exchange opens for business its closing price at 4pm EST when the NYSE
 * closes for regular business its low and high price during the day. At any point in time, the
 * total value of an investors holdings of a stock is simply the price of the stock at that time,
 * multiplied by the number of shares of that stock that the investor owns.
 * </p>
 * <p>This application helps users who are new to investing to learn about how money could grow, in
 * the style of virtual gambling. Similar to virtual gambling, our application will not use real
 * money and investment. Instead it will allow the user to create investment portfolios, try out
 * buying and selling of stock, and various investment strategies to see how they can grow (or
 * shrink) their money with time.</p>
 *
 * <p>this program has the following features:</p>
 * <p>Allow a user to create one or more portfolios and examine its composition.</p>
 * <p>Buy shares of some stock in a portfolio worth a certain amount at a certain date.</p>
 * <p>Determine the total cost basis and total value of a portfolio at a certain date.</p>
 *
 * <p>This interface provides operations that allows user to buy stocks, evaluate portfolios, and
 * create new portfolio.</p>
 *
 * <p>This model will also handle the case when the date entered is in future or weekend</p>
 *
 * <p>Since the application buy stocks from the past and data available is day to day basis hence,
 * closing of market after 4 pm cannot be handled.</p>
 *
 * <p>If the user wants to compare their stock which a date that is a weekand or holiday, then the
 * stock is compared with the price with the date when the stock market was last open. If the user
 * provides a date for which the data is unavailable, then it will inform the user that the data for
 * the particular company is unavailable.</p>
 *
 * <p>Invest a fixed amount into an existing portfolio containing multiple stocks, using a
 * specified weight for each stock in the portfolio.For example, the user can create a FANG
 * portfolio Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google and then specify to invest dollar 2000 in the
 * portfolio, such that 40percent goes towards Facebook, 20percent towards Apple, 30percent towards
 * Netflix and 10percent towards Google.</p>
 *
 * <p>program offers a more convenient way to use equal weights for all stocks in the
 * portfolio as a preset. For example, invest dollar 2000 in this portfolio by weighing each stock
 * equally e.g. 25percent each in the FANG portfolio above.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Add support for the user to specify the commission fee for a transaction, and factor these fees
 * in the cost basis of a portfolio.
 * </p>
