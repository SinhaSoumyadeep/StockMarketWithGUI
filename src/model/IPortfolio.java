 * <p>A portfolio of stocks is simply a collection of stocks (e.g. 10 shares of company X, 10
 * shares of company Y, etc.). The total value of a portfolio is then the sum of the values of its
 * individual holdings. Thus the value of a portfolio, much like individual stocks, also changes
 * with time. As an example, we hear about the SandP 500, Dow Jones Industrial and NASDAQ in the
 * news, quoted to gauge the health of the overall stock market. These three indices are nothing
 * more than portfolios of stocks of specific companies, which have been found to be reasonable
 * barometers of the health of the overall stock market and economy.</p>
 *
 * This interface allows various operations on portfolio objects such as adding stocks to the
 * portfolio, and calculate valuation of the portfolio.
