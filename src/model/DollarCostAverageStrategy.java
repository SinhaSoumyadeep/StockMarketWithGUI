/**
 * This class is an implementation of Dollar Cost Average Strategy which is a A popular long-term
 * passive investment strategy is called dollar cost averaging. In this strategy, an investor
 * creates a portfolio of stocks and determines their relative proportion example 60 percent stocks
 * 40 percent bonds with the stocks equally divided into technology financial utility real estate
 * consumer staple and consumer discretionary companies and the bonds equally divided into federal
 * state and municipal bonds. Then the investor invests a fixed amount of money in this portfolio at
 * regular frequency example invest dollar 1000 at the beginning of each month over a long period of
 * time paying no attention to what the stock market is doing on the days of the stock purchases.
 * This may be termed as the investment equivalent of putting a fixed amount of money in a savings
 * account each month.The benefit of this strategy is that it is extremely simple the investor does
 * not have to spend time and effort tweaking a portfolio, or monitoring the stock market. This
 * strategy is based on the well-founded hypothesis that although the stock prices fluctuate every
 * day, the long-term trend of a well-chosen portfolio is upward. The fixed-frequency investing
 * effectively averages the unpredictable short-term gains and losses of the portfolio. While this
 * strategy fails to capitalize on the market ups and downs it has the potential to produce a more
 * stable gain when the strategy is followed without hesitation over a long period of time. This
 * strategy is very popular for example most people manage their retirement accounts this way.This
 * interface provides method to execute the strategy on the passed portfolio.
